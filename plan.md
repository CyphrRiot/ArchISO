# ArchRiot ISO Builder - Current Status & Simple Plan

## üéØ SIMPLE GOAL

Build a custom Arch Linux ISO that includes:

1. **Standard archiso/releng** (works perfectly every time)
2. **Offline package cache** for ArchRiot packages
3. **Riot installer binary** (manual execution)

That's it. Nothing else.

## üìã CURRENT STATUS

### ‚úÖ What Works

- **Build process** completes successfully
- **Package cache** creation (184MB, clean)
- **Riot binary** exists at `airootfs/usr/local/bin/riot` and is executable
- **All required config files** exist
- **Processor limit** fixed (-j4 flag restored to mkarchiso)
- **SHA256 checksum** generation working
- **Offline pacman.conf** configuration working

### ‚ùå Current Problem

- **NOT TRULY OFFLINE** - installer still downloads packages from internet
- **Missing linux-firmware packages** - causes downloads during installation
- **Missing glibc and core dependencies** - forces internet downloads
- **Package list incomplete** - doesn't match ArchRiot's full requirements

### üóÇÔ∏è Current File State

- **Package list:** `configs/packages.txt` (needs to match ~/Code/ArchRiot/install/packages.txt)
- **Riot installer:** `airootfs/usr/local/bin/riot` (working binary, executable)
- **Config files:** All present in `configs/`
- **Build script:** `create-iso.sh` (working, with -j4 processor limit)
- **Cache directory:** 184MB+ of packages

## üîß CURRENT PROGRESS & NEXT STEPS

### ‚úÖ What's Fixed

1. **Build script working** - creates ISO successfully
2. **Processor limit** - restored -j4 flag to prevent system overload
3. **Package cache** - creates offline repository with database
4. **Riot installer** - properly executable and accessible
5. **SHA256 checksums** - generated for ISO verification

### üéØ CRITICAL ISSUE: NOT TRULY OFFLINE

**Problem:** Installer downloads packages from internet instead of using cache

**Root Cause Analysis:**

- Package list incomplete compared to ArchRiot requirements
- Missing linux-firmware-\* packages (huge downloads)
- Missing glibc and core system dependencies
- Cache doesn't contain ALL packages needed for installation

### üîß PROPOSED SOLUTION: COMPLETE OFFLINE PACKAGE SET

**Step 1: Get Complete Package List**

- Compare current packages.txt with ~/Code/ArchRiot/install/packages.txt
- Identify ALL missing packages (especially linux-firmware-\*)
- Add ALL linux-firmware packages to prevent downloads

**Step 2: Download Complete Package Set**

- Download ALL packages ArchRiot needs (including dependencies)
- Include all linux-firmware-\* variants
- Include glibc and all core system packages
- Cache size will grow significantly but be truly offline

**Step 3: Test Offline Installation**

- Verify NO internet downloads during riot installation
- Confirm all packages come from /opt/archriot-cache
- Test on disconnected system to verify offline capability

## üö® IMMEDIATE ACTION PLAN

### 1. Package List Analysis (FIRST)

- Read ~/Code/ArchRiot/install/packages.txt
- Compare with current configs/packages.txt
- Identify ALL missing packages (especially linux-firmware-\*)

### 2. Add ALL Linux Firmware Packages

- Add linux-firmware (base)
- Add linux-firmware-whence
- Add all specific firmware packages ArchRiot needs
- This should eliminate most internet downloads

### 3. Add Core System Dependencies

- Ensure glibc and all dependencies are cached
- Add any missing core packages that force downloads
- Include ALL transitive dependencies

### 4. Test TRUE Offline Installation

- Build ISO with complete package set
- Test installation with NO internet connection
- Verify zero downloads from internet during riot install

## üìä PACKAGE SET REQUIREMENTS

### Current State

- **Package count:** ~105 packages
- **Cache size:** 184MB
- **Status:** INCOMPLETE - causes internet downloads

### Target State

- **Package count:** ~300-500 packages (estimated with full firmware)
- **Cache size:** 800MB-1.5GB (estimated)
- **Status:** COMPLETE - truly offline installation

### Critical Missing Categories

1. **Linux firmware packages** (largest gap)
2. **Core system dependencies**
3. **ArchRiot-specific requirements**
4. **Transitive dependencies** not automatically included

## ‚úÖ SUCCESS CRITERIA

**Working system should:**

- Boot to root shell prompt
- Allow manual execution of `riot`
- Install packages from offline cache
- Complete ArchRiot installation offline

**NO automation, NO services, NO complexity.**

## ‚úÖ SUCCESS METRICS

### Current Build

- **ISO size:** ~800MB-1GB (with 184MB cache)
- **Package count:** ~105 packages
- **Cache size:** 184MB
- **Build time:** ~45-60 minutes
- **Offline capability:** PARTIAL (downloads still occur)

### Target Build

- **ISO size:** 1.5-2.5GB (with complete cache)
- **Package count:** 300-500 packages
- **Cache size:** 800MB-1.5GB
- **Build time:** ~60-90 minutes
- **Offline capability:** COMPLETE (zero downloads)
